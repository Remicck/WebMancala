## What's this?
Do you know mancala?  
Look this [Mancala - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala)

Im trying to create this game on web.

## WebRTC
Connecting with WebRTC that is [SkyWay](http://nttcom.github.io/skyway/). This is not the best way ? But you dont need a server :)

## APIKEY
If you should use this, get APIKEY from [SkyWay - WebRTCを簡単＆柔軟に使えるプラットフォーム](http://nttcom.github.io/skyway/) or use apikey for only localhost. You can get from here.

Sorry for my poor English.
